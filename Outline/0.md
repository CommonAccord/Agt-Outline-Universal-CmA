//=This is a somewhat unconventional organization of terms.  The idea is to have the "business" terms come first.  Then definitions, which can be intimately related to business terms.  (Definitions in agreements serve both as pure boilerplate, e.g, definition of "Affiliates" and as true parameters, for instance "Interest Rate.")  Then relationship elements (this should take care of a vast range of background "legal" issues), and then a small "Miscellaneous" section.  Note that the agreement is divided into four major sections.  This may aid reading and reduces the need for renumbering.

Point.Xnum=1

Deal.Xnum=2

Def.Xnum=3

Relate.Xnum=4

Misc.Xnum=5

sec=<ol>{Point.LI}{Deal.LI}{Def.LI}{Relate.LI}{Misc.LI}</ol>

//=This is a "US" frame for the agreement.  A French (FR) and a Polish (PL) frame are also available.

//=This is a set of parameterized (defined) terms.  They hyperlink to Definitions (when there).  They also appear with their own style (CSS "definedterm").
